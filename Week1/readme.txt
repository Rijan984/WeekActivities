Week1- Activity 2: Temperature Analysis Using Python and NumPy
 
Develop a Python project to perform the following tasks (import NumPy as np):
Calculate and print the average temperature for the week using NumPy.
Temperature data (in °C): [18.5, 19, 20, 25.0, 2, 30, 13.9]
Determine and display the highest and lowest recorded temperatures.
Convert all temperatures to Fahrenheit and print the converted values.
(Use the formula: F = C × 9/5 + 32)
Identify and print the indices of days where the temperature exceeded 20°C.
 Share you GitHub link here when you have done that.
